<h1 align="center">IP Addressing


</h1>
<p> <i>
	<p align="center">Each host on the internet is assigned a 32-bit integer address called its
internet address or IP address. The clever part of internet addressing is that
the integers are carefully chosen to make routing efficient. </p>
<b>
<p align="center">Every host and router on the internet has an IP address, which encodes its network number
and host number. The combination is unique: no two machines have the
same IP address. The address is coded to allow a variable allocation of bits to
specify network and host.</b>
</p>

	The IP address scheme is to break up the binary number into pieces and
represent each piece as a decimal number. A natural size for binary pieces is
8 bits, which is the familiar byte or octet (octet is the telecommunication term,
but two words can be used interchangeably). So letâ€™s take our binary number ,
write it using groups of 8 bits, and then represent each group as a decimal
number:</p>
<b>
<p>Example 1: 140.179.220.200</b></p>
<p>It is sometimes useful to view the values in their binary form.</p><b>
<p>140 .179 .220 .200</p><p>
10001100.10110011.11011100.11001000</p></b>
<p>Every IP address consists of two parts, one identifying the network and one
identifying the host. The Class of the address and the subnet mask determine
which part belongs to the network address and which part belongs to the host
address.</p>
<p><b>10111100 00011010 000111110 00111100
156 26 30 60</b></p>
<p>We can use a dot as a separator. Now our IP address has the form:</p>
<b>Example 2: 156.26.30.60
</b>which is referred to as the dotted decimal notation.
